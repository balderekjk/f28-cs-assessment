Explanatory Paragraph:
Unshift method scales a lot more poorly than push as
shown by the results. An array of over 100000 nums
shows how significant the difference is (828.87ms
vs. 3.84ms), 215x greater runtime, WOW. Reason being,
unshift requires each entry of array to move indices,
whereas push just appends to the end, and all other
indices remain in same places. With that being said,
I am still a bit perplexed as to why for small
(< 100)arrays the unshift is (very slightly) faster
than push, but it's so small it's almost negligible.
Still, I would like to know.
